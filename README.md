# simple-led-controller
A simple controller using switches and buttons for the led's on the Terasic DE10-Lite FPGA. This project was to explore the verification process including creating and designing testbenches for files, exploring through Questa/ModelSim and the compatibility with Quartus. It was also used to explore how to automatically run the tb's using a .do file.
